# Welcome to our virtual Pet Project!

## Instructions
You will start the game by creating your own pet! You will choose its name and species.

From there you will be able to play, feed, and take your pet to the doctor.

As time goes on their health, boredom, and hunger will be negatively effected so be weary!

## The shelter!

You will be able to adopt a robotic pet as well!

In the shelter you will be able to interact with all pets at once as well. Enjoy!
